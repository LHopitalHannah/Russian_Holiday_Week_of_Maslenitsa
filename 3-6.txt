You made it to the final day of Maslenitsa, [NAME]!

Today is forgiveness day.

Young married couples visit their family members and they give gifts to their matchmakers in thanks.

The most common gift for a man was a towel, and for a woman it was a bar of soap.

People would leave blini on their ancestors' graves.

While asking for forgiveness they would bow and listen for the reply, God will forgive you.

People must consume all leftover food, and finish the last of it with a piece of rye bread with salt,
to remind themselves of the Lent to come.

The final activity would be to burn the Lady Maslenitsa dolls, and the kids would walk over her ashes.

You survived the week of festivities! Take the rest of the evening to reflect on all of the fun that you had, and
get ready for Spring.

See you next year [NAME]!
