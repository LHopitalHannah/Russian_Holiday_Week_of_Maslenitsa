Hey [NAME],

Happy second day of Maslenitsa!

If you lived in Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus, today you would most likely be playing folk games with your friends and family,
and you would be getting very full off of blini.

An older tradition on the second day, would be for single guys to kiss any single girl that they liked. The second day
was seen as a matchmaking day. This was important, as it was considered very lucky for couples to get married on the sunday
after Easter, a holiday called Red Hill.
