Are you full yet, [NAME]?

Today is the 3rd day of Maslenitsa, and that means that all sons-in-law must visit their mothers-in-law.

The mothers-in-law will have prepared a large mountain of blini and the sons-in-law may treat themselves
to as many pancakes as they can eat.

Have as many servings as many times as a dog would wag its tail!

There are many ways to make these yummy pancakes. People typically put sour cream or cottage cheese, with fresh fruits
or jam preserves.

After you are sufficiently stuffed, people will normally celebrate their generous mothers-in-law and sing her praises.
