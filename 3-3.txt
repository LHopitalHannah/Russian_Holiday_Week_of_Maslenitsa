Historically, today was a day that fist fights occurred amongst soldiers.
Fist fighting was said to commemorate Russian military history, when soldiers supposedly fought each other in hand-to-hand combat.

An old russian proverb, Never hit a man when he is down. This proverb has roots found in Maslenitsa.

This essentially means that you should show mercy and compassion to a man, when he is unable to fight.

People are not supposed to break this rule, however, it has definitely historically happened.

A witness, a british Dr. Collins, was living in Moscow during the 1600s, and noted that one day,
more than 200 men were killed on this 4th day of celebration.
