Are you scared for the Gathering Day of Sisters in law , [NAME]?

Today is the time for newly married wives to get better acquainted with their sisters in laws.

In old time Russia, it was a very common occurrence for the two women to have a tense relationship.

It is funny to see how this tension is reflected in russian language, as sister-in-law in russian is zolovka,
which stems from the root, zlo, meaning evil.

Today is a day to work through the common animosity between these women!
