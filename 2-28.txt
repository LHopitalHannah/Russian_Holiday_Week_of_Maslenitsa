Hi [NAME],
Happy first day of Maslenitsa!

Today, we will learn a bit about the origins of one of the oldest slavic holidays and about how people usually
celebrate the first day of the week long festivities of Maslenitsa.

This festival includes both pagan and Orthodox traditions. Before Christianisation, Maslenitsa was known as a sun-festival,
where people use the week of festivities to wish goodbye to the cold winter and greet the warm spring.
However, in Christianity, Maslenitsa is the last chance for people to party, listen to music, and dance, as it would not
be acceptable during the Great Lent, which occurs the week after the celebration of Maslenitsa. The most important symbol
of Maslenitsa is the blin, a pancake, which represents the sun in the pagan tradition, and the last opportunity to enjoy
butter, milk, and eggs before lent. This pancake has a texture similar to a crepe.

On the first day of festivities, people create a large Lady doll made of straw and fun, colorful rags. She symbolizes the
winter, and on the last day of festivities, she is burnt down. However, during the week, she is the center, and people dance
and sing around her.
